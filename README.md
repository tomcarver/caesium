# Caesium

A fully client-side time-tracking web app using indexedDb and AngularJs. Live app: http://caesium.sastrugisoftware.com/

## Getting Started

Caesium is already stored as static content, but a basic runner that uses express to serve the content on a local port has been provided for convenience

    npm install
    npm start    // Caesium is now accessible at http://localhost:3000/
